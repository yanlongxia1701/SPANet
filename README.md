### Brief Introduction

Collaborative detection of internal-external surface in cold-drawn steel tubes(CSTs) to sustain high efficiency remains highly challenging. Existing detection technologies are typically designed for either internal or external surface defects in isolation, and usually carried out separately from the production line. Moreover, internal-external surface defects of CSTs typically
exhibit challenges, which may further degrade the performance of existing models. To effectively address the challenges, we propose a novel vision-based detection system, which is capable
of highly visualized, efficient, and fully non-contact surface defect detection. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive defect dataset for CSTs, named as CST1800, covering 13 representative
defect categories with real-world challenges. To achieve accurate defect detection, we propose Stereoscopic Perception Aggregation Network(SPANet). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that SPANet achieves superior detection performance
